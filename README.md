## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Movie Recommendation System utilizing machine learning techniques. The system aims to enhance user experience by providing personalized movie suggestions based on individual preferences.

## Key Features

- **Data Loading and Preparation**: Load and preprocess the movie rating data to create a suitable format for analysis.
- **Noise Removal**: Clean the data to remove any noise and irrelevant information.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the aggregated number of users who voted and the number of movies they voted on.
- **Sparsity Reduction**: Reduce the sparsity of the dataset using the `csr_matrix` function from the scipy library, ensuring efficient computation.
- **Recommendation Algorithm**: Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with a cosine distance metric to compute similarity between movies.
- **Recommendation Function**: Develop a function to generate movie recommendations for users.
- **Testing**: Test the recommendation system to evaluate its performance and accuracy.

## Conclusion

Building a movie recommendation system with machine learning significantly enhances user experience by providing personalized movie suggestions. By utilizing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms, the system leverages user behavior data to deliver accurate and relevant recommendations.
